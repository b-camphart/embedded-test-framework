# Obsidian To-do Plugin
This example plugin project shows how the embedded test framework could be used to test an obsidian plugin.
It directly imports the modules, but the relavent modules could be downloaded and copied into a "framework" folder within the `integration` directory.

Feel free to copy the code in this project and use it for yourself.
